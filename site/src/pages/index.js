      <h3>EcoPoints for Monday Teams</h3>
      <p>
        EcoPoints can be anything and are calculated per board. Sales, time spent, or just an arbitrary number. As long as it's a number column in your tasks, you can set it in your settings!
        Teams pledge to remove carbon in exchange for productivity, and Team Members that have the most EcoPoints accrued will gain the most credit!
      </p>
      <h3>Carbon Captured</h3>
      <p>
        We use a carbon credit market to help teams remove carbon from the air.
        We only purchase natural carbon removal credits, which are projects that sequester carbon dioxide through natural processes, like planting trees.
